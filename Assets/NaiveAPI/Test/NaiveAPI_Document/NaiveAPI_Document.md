## Naive's API

![image](img_0.png)

This API is  constructed by  extracting  the  more commonly
used and  common  functions  when I developing  games. It 
may  not be very  suitable  for  large-scale projects and it is 
not a  deep study of a  certain  functional area, but I believe 
it is  good  for  small  and  medium-sized  projects. Such  as
GameJem etc.

This Document Book contains all document about my API's 
class and function. Hope it can help you to  understand  my
tools easily. If you have any question, there is  my  Contact 
Information.
